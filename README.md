# Compress.ItzCtrl.com

The most basic compression website I could make. It uses a form of lossy compression, meaning that quality of files will most likely be lost (i.e less bit depth for images, meaning smaller range of colours available), however the file size will be greatly diminished. This is great if you want to transmit a file to get a general message across but there are file size limitations (such as discord only allowing 10MB for non-nitro users).

I maybe plan on adding more options in the future, such as a lossless type of compression which would not decrease the quality at all but the file size won't decrease by much. 

At this point in time, this is just a very basic prototype. Feel free to take inspiration and make your own.
